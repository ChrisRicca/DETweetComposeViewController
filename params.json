{"name":"DETweetComposeViewController","body":"DETweetComposeViewController\r\n============================\r\n\r\nDETweetComposeViewController uses git submodules to pull in the [unoffical-twitter-sdk](https://github.com/doubleencore/unoffical-twitter-sdk). Be sure to run \r\n```git submodule update --init``` on your DETweetComposeViewController  clone before proceeding.\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\nDETweetComposeViewController is an iOS 4 compatible version of the TWTweetComposeView controller. Otherwise known as the Tweet Sheet.\r\n\r\n## Why did we make it?\r\nThe iOS 5 TWTweetComposeViewController makes it really simple to integrate Twitter posting into you applications. However we still need to support iOS 4 in many of our applications. Having something that looks and acts like the built in Tweet Sheet allows us to have a consistent user interface across iOS versions.\r\n\r\n## What does it look like?\r\n![DETweetComposeViewController](https://github.com/downloads/doubleencore/DETweetComposeViewController/DETweetComposeViewController.png) ![TWTweetComposeViewController](https://github.com/downloads/doubleencore/DETweetComposeViewController/TWTweetComposeViewController.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see they look very similar.  \r\n  \r\n## How do you use it?\r\n\r\n1. Add all the files from the DETweetComposeViewController/DETweetComposeViewController folder to your project.\r\n2. From DETweetComposeViewController/DETweeter/unofficial-twitter-sdk/unoffical-twitter-sdk, add the following to a group in your project named unoffical-twitter-sdk:\r\n    1. JSON/\r\n    2. OAuth/\r\n    3. tclose.png\r\n    4. ticon.png\r\n    5. TwitterDialog.h\r\n    6. TwitterDialog.m\r\n3. Link your project against the follwoing frameworks:\r\n    1. Accounts.framework\r\n    2. Twitter.framework.\r\n4. Set your Twitter OAuth Consumer Key and Consumer Secret in OAuthConsumerCredentials.h in your project, you will find this file in unoffical-twitter-sdk/OAuth. Don't have an OAuth consumer key and secret? Go to developer.twitter.com to create an app. Make sure your app's Access is set to 'Read and Write' and a Callback URL is defined. Both of these configurations can be found under the Settings of your Twitter app.\r\n5. You will notice there is an #error in OAuthConsumerCredentials.h to help ensure you remember to add your Twitter OAuth credentials, remember to delete this #error after you have added your OAuth credentials.\r\n6. Use it almost just like you would a TWTweetComposeViewController\r\n\r\n```\r\n#import \"DETweetComposeViewController.h\"\r\n...\r\nDETweetComposeViewController *tcvc = [[[DETweetComposeViewController alloc] init] autorelease];\r\n[tcvc addImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"YawkeyBusinessDog.jpg\"]];\r\n[tcvc addURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://www.DoubleEncore.com/\"]];\r\n[tcvc addURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://www.apple.com/ios/features.html#twitter\"]];\r\nself.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCurrentContext;\r\n[self presentModalViewController:tcvc animated:YES];\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What if I don't want to use the unofficial-twitter-sdk?\r\n\r\nJust save the necessary OAuth credentils to NSUserDefaults as:\r\n\r\n * detwitter_oauth_token\r\n * detwitter_oauth_token_secret\r\n * detwitter_oauth_token_authorized\r\n\r\nThen call the OAuth ```- (void) loadOAuthContextFromUserDefaults;``` method.\r\n\r\n## What's next?\r\n\r\nWe have some TODO items in [github Issues](https://github.com/doubleencore/DETweetComposeViewController/issues). Please send us your feature requests, patches and pull requests.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n1. unofficial-twitter-sdk [lloydsparkes](https://github.com/lloydsparkes)\r\n2.
